This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```


```{r}
# This script calls the libraries and sets up other variables that are necessary for analysis
# You should also make sure to set up you .Renivron file - use the example as a template
source("./01-scripts/set-up.R")
```

```{r}
# This script loads the data from the excel file and combines and formats the data
source("./01-scripts/get-datasets.R")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Datasets generated
mouseInfo
mouseRecording
cellInfo
cellBinnedFiring
cyclesData
agdData
maturationData
```

# Recorded Mice Information
```{r}
mouseRecording
```

# Cell Information
```{r}
cellInfo
```

# Cell Firing Data - 1 min bins
```{r}
cellBinnedFiring
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
